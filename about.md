My name is Nasirodin Mazrooei (the guy who smiling at the left) . 

I started my career as a software engineer after graduating with a master's in software engineering from the University of Kashan in 2013.<br/>
Currently, I'm working in [Dotin](https://www.dotin.ir/) software corporation as a software engineer. at Dotin we mainly focused on developing software solutions for financial institutes (Core banking systems, Payments solutions, ERP, ... )<br/>
Recently I joined [BIMLOGiQ](http://bimlogiq.com/) as a part-time BIM developer. a rapid-growing startup providing AI solutions for the construction industry.
